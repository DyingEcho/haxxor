Haxxor is a programming language I'm making for fun. Eventually it'll be Turing Complete... -ish.

## Running haxxor code

Once installed, run .hx files like this:
```
haxxor /path/to/script.hx false
```
 (You may be wondering what the `false` is for... don't worry, it'll be useful soon. Just use it for now and all will be well.)

## Writing haxxor code
You can read the documentation in [specs.md](specs.md). If you have any questions and a thorough reading of the docs doesn't help, [submit an issue](../../issues).

There's a custom file type for developing in PyCharm which you can download [here](filetype.jar).
